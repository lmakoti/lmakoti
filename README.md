### <center> ðŸŒŽ</Hello World> </center>

> It is 12 August 2025, and today marks 10 years of my working experience, and in that time, I've been a `IT Support Technician`, `Software Engineer`, `Data Manager` and now I'm a `Data Management Analytics Specialist` - Fancy Fancy ðŸ˜‚ and I've just completed my MSc in Data Science on 11 July 2025, so yes, I fell for the AI is taking over bid, and now I'm at the ship's helm, but I'm clueless about our destination. The more I dig the more confusion I keep unpacking. But alas, I digress ...

Please join me on my journey to build a career/hobby I hope to be proud of when I look back years from now. My primary focus is to consolidate my `work + learning` experiences to find ways in which I can build solutions and offer re-usable documentation (templates, assets etc.) which anyone can use to make their lives easier. For the greater part I'll be using data recycled from world renowned sources such as the World Bank, World Health Organisation, OECD, WTO, CDC etc. and some lesser known datasets on Kaggle. These will be coupled with resources that are publicly available, but tailored to deliver my message in the best way I can capture and shout out for the world to hear.

## README Objective(s)

This readme will be split into two sections, the first focusing on tooling assets on all things data, but leaning more torwards data management through the lens of the [DAMA-DMBoK](https://dama.org/learning-resources/dama-data-management-body-of-knowledge-dmbok/) as our standard, while the second focuses on projects new and old, which you might find interesting and can be templated without any copyright issues.

## 1. Documentation and Tooling
... `info goes here`

## 2. Public Projects

### United Nations International Days and Weeks

These are the international days and weeks currently observed by the United Nations. 

**Observed Days** - <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/list-days-weeks" target="_blank">View List</a>

The United Nations designates specific days, weeks, years and decades as occasions to **mark particular events or topics in order to promote,  through awareness and action, the objectives of the Organization.**  Usually, it is one or more Member States that propose these observances  and the General Assembly establishes them with a resolution.

On occasion, these celebrations are declared by the specialized  agencies of the United Nations, such as UNESCO, UNICEF, FAO, etc., when  they concern issues that fall within the scope of their competencies.  Some of them may be later adopted by the General Assembly.

### Progress Metrics for Assessing Improvement (KPIs)

Data products just like any other digital service/product have metrics through which the idea of a successful implementation can be based and assessed, this leads to the setting of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help in the evaluation of progress tracking as more products are delivered. Below is a list that outlines each KPI and the definition of the metric it takes into account:

1. **Development turnaround time** - a metric for estimating how long it will take to complete development of a data product, ensuring delivery of the product on the set date for the UN international day or week to promote relevance and significance. With continuous reporting and monitoring of this metric, product managers and engineering managers can validate engineering estimates against their proven history. This provides for more accurate time estimates and more reliable roadmaps.

2. **Quality assessment** - all products have to be developed with quality in mind, user sentiment will be recorded and evaluated from all the product's publishing platforms mostly on social media.

3. **Product user views count** - once developed and deployed, the data product's success will be measured by the number of views (not discrete), that the product will receive through social media (Facebook, LinkedIn) and data publishing platforms (Tableau Public)

### Selected UN International Days and Projects

Below is a link to the data products' development calendar based on the thematic events I have selected to be part of this portfolio. 

**NB** This selection in **no** way prioritizes or ranks any of the events, this is purely on personal preference and my work schedule.

**Selected UN Days and Weeks** -  <a href="resource\Selected UN Days.md" target="_blank">View Selection List</a>

### Publishing Platforms

The portfolio will be developed and maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/lmakoti/), below is how the repositories and updates to their content will be managed.

**Data Product Naming Convention** - SDG'X' - 'Thematic Area' , X is the main SDG in focus and 'Thematic Area' is the focus of the selected UN event.

**Folder Structure (Root)**

> Data Product file (Dashboard/Report) 
> 'Event name - SDGX (UN Document Code)'
> e.g. International Day of Education - SDG4 (A_RES_73_25-242024)

**Sub-Folders**
* **Description** (readme.md) - theme description based on the UN issued documentation on the topic.
* **Meta-Content** - Support/Connect (Social profiles)
* **Licensing** - Creative Commons (CC)

**Folders**

1. **Data Source** - store theme associated data sources from relevant UN agencies (**NB**. UN has 16 specialised agencies)

2. **ETL Architecture (Pipeline)** - 

3. **Resources** - store any pictures or graphics associated with building the dashboard

4. **Dashboard/Report** - data product presentation in a dashboard/report format
