### <p style="text-align: center">Hi, Welcome to my Analytics Portfolio </p>

<img src="resource\banner.png" alt="portfolio banner">

Please join me on my journey to build an analytics portfolio with data recycled from world renowned sources such as the World Bank, World Health Organisation, OECD, WTO, CDC etc.

## Portfolio Objective

The aim in building this portfolio is to focus on developing data products based on selected international days and weeks observed by the UN, the primary objective of this process is to be a continuous improvement initiative aimed at improving my analytical work competency. The secondary aim is to improve competency in the use and deployment of data tools and solutions respectively.

Implementing these data products also offers a unique chance to experiment with analytics platforms including PowerBI, Tableau, Google Data Studio, QlikSense, Excel etc., and as a result of the development work, a comparison will be done on each of the tools to assess the benefits of using one over the others based on the analysis context and simplicity of development, this will be measured using the KPIs outlined in the next section.



## United Nations International Days and Weeks

These are the international days and weeks currently observed by the United Nations. 

**Observed Days** - <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/list-days-weeks" target="_blank">View List</a>

The United Nations designates specific days, weeks, years and decades as occasions to **mark particular events or topics in order to promote,  through awareness and action, the objectives of the Organization.**  Usually, it is one or more Member States that propose these observances  and the General Assembly establishes them with a resolution.

On occasion, these celebrations are declared by the specialized  agencies of the United Nations, such as UNESCO, UNICEF, FAO, etc., when  they concern issues that fall within the scope of their competencies.  Some of them may be later adopted by the General Assembly.



## Progress Metrics for Assessing Improvement (KPIs)

Data products just like any other digital service/product have metrics through which the idea of a successful implementation can be based and assessed, this leads to the setting of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help in the evaluation of progress tracking as more products are delivered. Below is a list that outlines each KPI and the definition of the metric it takes into account:

1. **Development turnaround time** - a metric for estimating how long it will take to complete development of a data product, ensuring delivery of the product on the set date for the UN international day or week to promote relevance and significance. With continuous reporting and monitoring of this metric, product managers and engineering managers can validate engineering estimates against their proven history. This provides for more accurate time estimates and more reliable roadmaps.

2. **Quality assessment** - all products have to be developed with quality in mind, user sentiment will be recorded and evaluated from all the product's publishing platforms mostly on social media.

3. **Product user views count** - once developed and deployed, the data product's success will be measured by the number of views (not discrete), that the product will receive through social media (Facebook, LinkedIn) and data publishing platforms (Tableau Public)



### Data Product Development Tools

These are the tentative tools to be used in developing the data products:

1. Microsoft PowerBI
2. Tableau Public
3. Google Data Studio
4. Informatica
5. QlikSense
6. Sisense
7. Microsoft Excel
8. D3.Js
9. Chart.JS
10. Python Graphing Libraries (Plotly, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Bokeh)

## Selected UN International Days and Weeks

Below is a link to the data products' development calendar based on the thematic events I have selected to be part of this portfolio. 

**NB** This selection in **no** way prioritizes or ranks any of the events, this is purely on personal preference and my work schedule.

**Selected UN Days and Weeks** -  <a href="resource\Selected UN Days.md" target="_blank">View Selection List</a>



## Publishing Platforms

The portfolio will be developed and maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/lmakoti/), below is how the repositories and updates to their content will be managed.

**Under Review**

**Data Product Naming Convention** - SDG'X' - 'Thematic Area' , X is the main SDG in focus and 'Thematic Area' is the focus of the selected UN event.

**Folder Structure (Root)**

> Data Product file (Dashboard/Report) 
> 'Event name - SDGX (UN Document Code)'
> e.g. International Day of Education - SDG4 (A_RES_73_25-242024)

**Sub-Folders**
* **Description** (readme.md) - theme description based on the UN issued documentation on the topic.
* **Meta-Content** - Support/Connect (Social profiles)
* **Licensing** - Creative Commons (CC)

**Folders**

1. **Data Source** - store theme associated data sources from relevant UN agencies (**NB**. UN has 16 specialised agencies)

2. **ETL Architecture (Pipeline)** - 

3. **Resources** - store any pictures or graphics associated with building the dashboard

4. **Dashboard/Report** - data product presentation in a dashboard/report format
