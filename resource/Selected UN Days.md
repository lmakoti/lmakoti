## Selected UN International Days and Weeks

### Understanding the Document Coding

The numbers and letters in document symbols do not directly indicate the  topic of the document; rather they serve to identify, in following  order:

- the body or organ *that issued the document â€“ comprised of the parent body or special body.*
- the subsidiary body responsible for the document - *either the standing committee or subsidiary body of the parent body.*
- the organizational session or year *during which the document was issued*
- the *document type*
- the unique number of the document
- **Reference Code** 
  - A/ ... - General Assembly
  - ../RES/... - Mimeograph texts of adopted resolutions
  - .../.../73/25 - General Assembly Resolution
